This block diagram illustrates the system architecture of the Linefollower

### 1. QTR-8 Sensor Array  
- **Connection**: Connected to analog pins 6-11 for line detection.  
- **Function**: The infrared sensors provide HIGH/LOW outputs depending on the surface reflectivity (black or white).  
- **Software Logic**: Sensor values are read using the ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), and the calibration process ensures accurate readings.

### 2. DC Motors  
- **Control**: Managed via GPIO pins through the Motor Shield.  
- **Pins**: The Motor Shield uses digital pins to control motor speed and direction.  
- **PID Control**: The robot adjusts the motor speeds based on the line position calculated using the PID control algorithm to maintain line following.

### 3. LCD 16x2 Display  
- **Connection**: Connected through an I2C module.  
- **Function**: Displays sensor readings, system data, and the status of the robot. The display updates in real-time, showing whether the robot is centered, left, or right of the line.

### 4. Potentiometer  
- **Connection**: Adjusts the LCD display contrast.  
- **Wiring**: Connected to 5V, GND, and an analog input pin to allow easy adjustments of the display contrast.

### 5. RGB LED  
- **Control**: The Red and Green pins are connected to separate digital pins for controlling brightness and color mixing.  
- **Software Control**: The LED can be programmed to indicate different statuses, such as "Line Lost" or "Line Followed."

### 6. Power Supply  
- **Battery**: The system is powered via a 9V battery connected to the Arduino’s barrel jack input.  
- **Motor Power**: The Motor Shield draws power directly from the 9V battery to drive the motors, ensuring sufficient power for both the motors and the sensors.

## Software Design  
- **Development Environment:** Arduino IDE  
- **Libraries and 3rd-Party Sources:**  
  - LiquidCrystal Library for LCD control  
  - Arduino standard libraries for motor and sensor control  
- **Algorithms and Structures:**  
  - **PID Control:** The robot uses a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to follow the line efficiently.  
  - **ADC Reading:** Sensors are read using the Arduino’s ADC pins, ensuring the robot can detect the black line on a white surface.  
  - **GPIO Control:** Motors and LEDs are controlled through the GPIO pins on the Arduino board.  
- **Serial Debugging:** Serial communication is used to output sensor readings, PID values, and motor adjustments to monitor the robot’s behavior in real time. This helps in troubleshooting and fine-tuning the robot’s performance.  
- **Implemented Code:** The main loop reads sensor data, applies PID control, and adjusts the motor speeds accordingly.

## Sensor Calibration
To calibrate the sensors, the system reads the minimum and maximum ADC values for each sensor to adjust for variations in surface reflectivity.

- Initialization: Each sensor is initialized with max (1023) and min (0) values.
- Calibration: The system reads sensor values and updates the min/max for each sensor based on detected surface (black or white).
- Final Calibration: Once complete, the sensor’s calibration values are stored for use during line-following, ensuring accurate detection.
